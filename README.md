## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

the project required to add functionality to a static landing page using javascript ..

first : i made the navigation bar which have links built dynamically by looping over the sections and add li element if the sections increase then i added them into html page.

second : i made two functions .. one for adding active class to the section when it is in viewport and one to remove the class if the section is no longer on the viewport.
i get the actual position of the element using getBoundingClientRect() function .

third: required to let the viewer when clicking of the link . it should goes to the appropriate section .. so i used eventlistener to go to the appropiate section .

forth: in suggestions i liked to add top top button using javascript . so i made it by make the button display block when u scroll down and display none when u come back up.

i made the page as responsive as possible when viewing on other devices by adding media styles on css stylesheet
